    According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. is expected to grow in population by 78 million in the next four decades 
    from 326 to 404 million (1.8 million growth per year). The demand for additional healthcare professionals by 2030 is fueled in part 
    by the large number of aging baby boomers, who are staying more active later in life than their counterparts of previous generations. 
    The number of individuals older than 65 is expected to double from 49 million to 95 million by 2060. The year 2030 marks a demographic 
    turning point in the U.S. as all baby boomers will be over 65 years of age. This will expand the size of the older population to 25% 
    compared to 15% today. This means that one in every four Americans is expected to be of retirement age. In 2035, the older population 
    will outnumber children for the first time in US history. Life expectancy is 83.5 years for women and 79.5 for men. Older adults are 
    more likely to experience heart attacks, strokes, and mobility-related injuries that require extensive medical and rehabilitation services. 
    In addition, a number of chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity have become more prevalent in recent years. More healthcare 
    professionals will be needed to help these patients maintain their mobility and manage the effects of chronic conditions.

    Given the opioid epidemic and well documented over utilization of high-cost procedures such as surgery and diagnostic imaging, 
    non-physician healthcare professionals are projected to be a cost-effective solution within healthcare reform. Advances in medical 
    technology have increased the use of outpatient surgery to treat a variety of injuries and illnesses. Medical and technological 
    developments also are expected to permit a greater percentage of trauma victims and newborns with birth defects to survive, creating 
    additional demand for medical and rehabilitative care. Non-physician healthcare professionals will continue to play an important role 
    in helping these patients recover more quickly from surgery. Job opportunities are expected to be robust for non-physician healthcare 
    professionals in all settings. Job prospects should be particularly strong in acute-care hospitals, skilled-nursing facilities, and 
    orthopedic settings, where the elderly are most often treated. Job prospects should be especially favorable in rural areas because 
    many non-physician healthcare professionals live in highly populated urban and suburban areas.

    Graduate healthcare education is currently faced with extensive challenges such as a shortage of qualified faculty and quality 
    clinical education/externship sites, the inability to meet the education and healthcare needs of rural communities, and the unsustainable 
    cost of education. The COVID-19 pandemic has further magnified these challenges and highlighted the need for programs to be delivered in a 
    hybrid, accelerated format that increases flexibility, improves access, reduces student debt by assisting graduates getting into the 
    workforce sooner, meets workforce demands, and impacts health care in underserved communities by increasing diversity and keeping students 
    connected to the communities where they live.
    
    This highly differentiated program addresses many of the current challenges because of the innovative hybrid, accelerated model. Our hybrid, 
    accelerated curriculum will leverage best-in-class educational technology, with online coursework being delivered by faculty in a highly 
    interactive and engaging environment. Synchronous and asynchronous learning activities will be utilized to foster student discovery. Onsite 
    lab instruction will be provided in an immersive, highly organized, well-executed, and active hands-on learning environment that is critical 
    to psychomotor skill development. This educational model allows students and faculty to live anywhere in the country and commute to the 
    campus for onsite immersion lab experiences. Students will also participate in highly structured, full-time clinical education experiences.
